# PyTextEditor

A simple text editor implemented in Python using Tkinter.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Basic Text Editing:** Create, open, edit, and save text files.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive GUI built with Tkinter.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Runs on any platform that supports Python and Tkinter.
*   **Simple and Lightweight:** Easy to use and understand.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Python:** Version 3.6 or higher.
*   **Tkinter:** Tkinter is usually included with Python installations. If not, install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install python3-tk` on Debian/Ubuntu).

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bakytbekovJ27/PyTextEditor.git
    cd PyTextEditor
    ```

2.  **Verify Dependencies:**

    Ensure Python and Tkinter are installed.

3.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    python pytexteditor.py
    ```

## Usage Examples

*   **Running the Editor:**

    After installation, simply execute the `pytexteditor.py` script. This will launch the text editor window.

*   **Creating a New File:**

    Use the "File" menu, then select "New".

*   **Opening an Existing File:**

    Use the "File" menu, then select "Open".  A file dialog will allow you to select a text file to open.

*   **Saving a File:**

    Use the "File" menu, then select "Save" or "Save As...".

*   **Editing Text:**

    Type directly into the text area to edit the content.

## Configuration Options

There are currently no external configuration options.  All settings are managed within the application itself. The window size is pre-defined in the `pytexteditor.py` file.  To change this, modify the `root.geometry("800x600")` line.
